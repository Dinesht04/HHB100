HealthHub100 - Interactive Symptom Checker with Body Map
A MERN App - An Interactive Symptom Checker with a 2-D Body Map. 
This was my first mern stack project, did all of it by myself - coming up with the idea, Self-teaching myself react from docs, ChatGPT and various youtube tutorials.
It was very difficult but I wouldn't have it any other way. It gave me enough self-confidence to approach a framework or any challenge in life without fear, knowing my
hardwork and dedication would help me get through.
